![Obi-wan Kenobi says 'Hello there'](assets/images/obiwan_thumb.jpg) Hello there.

I'm Craig. I'm a software developer, startup founder, speaker and music producer.

This blog is a space where I can put notes on things that interest me, show you what I'm working on, learn in public and hopefully help anyone on a similar journey.

If you fancy a chat, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Migweld) or [Email](mailto:craig@thompsonyorks.co.uk) are the best ways to contact me.
